          With 10 years of self-taught cake design experience, I started by creating cakes for
          family and friends, gradually building confidence through competitions. My passion led me
          to leave my full-time job and launch my own business. Since then, Iâ€™ve trained in modern
          wedding cakes, perfecting my craft to create beautiful, custom designs that bring special
          moments to life!
